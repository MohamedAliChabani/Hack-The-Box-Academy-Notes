## <mark class="hltr-cyan">Antak Webshell</mark>

Antak is a web shell built-in ASP.Net included within the [Nishang project](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang).

Antak utilizes PowerShell to interact with the host, making it great for acquiring a web shell on a Windows server.

The Antak files can be found in the `/usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell` directory.

Antak web shell functions like a Powershell Console. However, it will execute each command as a new process. It can also execute scripts in memory and encode commands you send. As a web shell, Antak is a pretty powerful tool.

Modify the shell file (changer username and passwd)
